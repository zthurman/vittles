# vittles

This project (when complete) will basically glue [xcookybooky](https://github.com/SvenHarder/xcookybooky) into
[PyLaTeX](https://github.com/JelteF/PyLaTeX). So we're just piggybacking off of all of their actual hard work to
make something that might be nifty to like twelve people in the world.

## tests

The tests for the project can be run with a make target like this:

- `make test`

## formatter

This code is formatted with `black`. To use it:

- `make devenv` (creates a local venv for you called `devenv`)

- `make format`
